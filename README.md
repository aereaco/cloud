# Aerea Cloud

Aerea Cloud is a web-based Multitenant SaaS platform designed to streamline and manage various business operations. It offers a comprehensive suite of tools, including CMS, CRM, ERP, HRM, Email, Chat, Groupware, and other essential business-related features. These features are modular, allowing for the development of third-party plugins and add-ons to enhance functionality.

The platform supports advanced user management, including local login with two-factor authentication, OpenID, OAuth, SSO, SAML, and LDAP, ensuring secure and flexible authentication. Authorization is implemented using Group Management and dynamic Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage user permissions effectively.

Built with modern technologies, the frontend leverages NuxtJS for a seamless user experience, while the backend is powered by NestJS, providing a robust and scalable infrastructure. SurrealDB serves as the primary data store, offering a flexible and efficient database solution. The UI is styled using Bootstrap, ensuring a responsive and visually appealing interface.

Aerea Cloud is structured as a monorepo using `pnpm` as the package manager, allowing for streamlined development and deployment processes. This approach ensures consistency across the codebase and facilitates contributions from other developers, supporting the project's open-source nature.
